# BTCPayWall - The Bitcoin Paywall to sell content and digital products on WordPress

**BTCPayWall supports four different modules to distribute its digital products and content:**

- Pay-per-post for the sale of individual blog posts and newspaper articles

With the Digital Store you can sell your digital files and the customer can download this file to his computer.
