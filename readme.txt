# BTCPayWall - The Bitcoin Paywall to sell content and digital products on WordPress
[![IMAGE_ALT](https://img.youtube.com/vi/gjxcc1Ld3R8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxcc1Ld3R8)
**BTCPayWall offers four distinct modules for delivering its digital products and content:**

- Pay-per-post for individual blog posts and news articles
- Pay-per-view for direct video playback sales
- Download store for selling downloadable digital files
- Tipping for accepting donations and tips

Offer individual blog articles, digital content like videos, eBooks, or PDF files, and accept tips and donations on your website.

**Single Article Payment _(Pay-per-Post)_**
Using BTCPayWall, introduce a Bitcoin Paywall for individual blog posts. Allow readers the flexibility to purchase just one article rather than commit to a monthly subscription.

**Direct Content Access _(Pay-per-View)_**
Provide immediate access to digital content. Through the View module, offer video or audio files to your audience for a fee, and let them play it directly on your website.

**Digital Download Store**
In the Download Store, sell digital files that customers can conveniently download to their computers.

**Accept Tips & Donations**
Gain financial backing from your website's visitors, either as tips or contributions to larger initiatives.

**Publisher Benefits**
Sell premium content to readers who prefer purchasing individual top-notch articles over monthly subscriptions. As a publisher, BTCPayWall allows you to:

- Generate revenue from your exceptional content, reducing reliance on banner ads.
- Monetize without binding users to monthly memberships.
- Provide free posts, charging only for exclusive, high-quality content.
- Offer teaser content for free, with a seamless transition to paid content.

**BTCPayWall's Value to the Customer**

Many customers are deterred by long-term subscriptions, especially when they're interested in just one article. BTCPayWall addresses this by enabling spontaneous, anonymous digital content purchases without the hassle of extensive sign-ups or personal data sharing.

- No need for account creation or registration.
- Ensures user privacy, avoiding personal data collection.
- Bypass lengthy subscription steps for a one-time read.
- Swift and straightforward payment using Bitcoin and Lightning.

**Payment Methods**

For your digital content transactions, BTCPayWall offers cutting-edge payment methods using both Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. The versatile payment infrastructure supports renowned platforms including BTCPay Server, OpenNode, Coinsnap, and LNbits. 

You have the flexibility to either integrate with your personal BTCPay server or take advantage of the shared server provided by Coincharge. Moreover, it is possible to integrate with OpenNode, a leading Bitcoin and Lightning payment provider, or use LNBits to further enhance your transaction experience.
